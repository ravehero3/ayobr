Thanks for uploading the screenshot! Based on the UI in the image, here's what you can now **add to your Replit message** so the app theme is visually consistent with the style in the screenshot:

---

### 🎨 Add this to your Replit prompt (UI theme update):

> Please update the look of the app to match the dark UI theme shown in the screenshot I uploaded. Apply the following styling across the app:
>
> #### 🧱 General Layout
>
> * **Background**: solid matte black (`#0D0D0D` or similar)
> * **Container background**: very dark gray (`#1A1A1A`)
> * **Rounded corners**: apply `rounded-lg` or around `0.75rem` (12px) radius
> * **Border**: subtle light gray border or outline on hover/focus (`#333` or Tailwind `border-neutral-700`)
> * **Shadows**: apply soft inner or outer shadow to make the containers feel slightly lifted (like in the screenshot)
>
> #### 🎧 Audio waveform container
>
> * Use a **white waveform on black background**
> * Keep waveform height consistent across containers
> * Use light gray dotted progress line (`#999` or `#AAA`)
>
> #### 🎛 Movehandle
>
> * The drag/movehandle should be a white **plus icon** with arrow ends (↕️↔️), similar to a crosshair or move cursor
> * Place in top-left corner inside each container, slightly indented (around 8–12px padding)
> * On hover: slightly brighter background or subtle glow
>
> #### ⏱ Time Display
>
> * Place time labels (e.g. "00:00 / 03:12") **above** the waveform in a subtle gray font (`#888`)
> * Use compact font (maybe Tailwind `text-xs` or `text-sm`)
>
> #### 🧩 Container Spacing
>
> * Add padding between rows and slight spacing between `AudioContainer` and `ImageContainer` inside each row
> * Use `gap-4` or `gap-6` depending on app scale
>
> #### 🔁 Drag & Drop Copy UI
>
> * While dragging:
>
>   * Show `audiocontainercopy` with same size, same styling
>   * Add soft outer glow or transparent background blur to indicate it’s floating
>   * Optional: slight scale-up effect (`scale(1.02)`) for feedback
> * Animate containers slightly moving apart when one is being dragged, like in modern drag UI libraries (Framer Motion or similar)
>
> #### ⏹️ Buttons (Download / Play)
>
> * Use **solid white icons** inside **round black buttons**
> * On hover: apply subtle glow or border-light effect
>
> ---
>
> ✅ Match the entire app’s look and spacing to the screenshot style as much as possible, but **do not change the core logic, layout or break existing functionality**.

Let me know if you want me to generate TailwindCSS classes or React component style examples to help Replit even more.
