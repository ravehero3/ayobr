Analyzed video and container naming issues (13 seconds)
You're absolutely right to spot these issues - they're both significant problems that need fixing. Let me analyze what's happening and create a comprehensive plan to solve them like a senior engineer would.
🔍 Root Cause Analysis
Issue 1: Second Video Progress Bug (0% → 99% → 0% → slow crawl)
This is a classic race condition in the FFmpeg progress tracking system. Here's what's likely happening:
1. First video finishes → Progress callback still active
2. Second video starts → Gets assigned, shows 0%
3. First video's final progress event fires late → Reports 99-100%, gets incorrectly applied to second video
4. Progress resets → Second video's actual progress starts from 0%
5. Slow counting → Real progress, but seems slower because user expects continuation
The core problem: Progress callbacks from previous videos are bleeding into new videos because FFmpeg instances or progress listeners aren't being properly cleaned up between sequential jobs.
Issue 2: Container Naming (Pair 2, 3, 4, blank)
This is a display index assignment bug. Looking at the system:
* When files are dropped, assignDisplayIndex() should assign sequential numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...)
* But the first pair likely gets created with default empty pairs, then files are added
* The assignment logic might be skipping the first pair or starting from the wrong index
The root cause is likely in the pairing logic - when you drop 4+4 files, the system creates pairs but the display index assignment happens at the wrong time or in the wrong order.
📋 Comprehensive Fix Plan
Let me check the current state first to give you an accurate plan:

Planned comprehensive fix strategy (10 seconds)
Perfect, I've identified both root causes. Let me give you a comprehensive senior-level plan to fix these issues properly.
🎯 Comprehensive Fix Plan
Problem 1: Display Index Bug (Pair 2, 3, 4, blank)
Root Cause Identified:
* App starts with 2 default empty pairs
* When you drop 4 audio + 4 image files, it reuses those 2 pairs + creates 2 new ones
* Display indices are assigned AFTER pairs exist, but the initial pairs already have a nextDisplayIndex that started at 1
* Result: First pair might get skipped or not displayed
The Fix:
1. Force display index reassignment when files are dropped to ensure sequential numbering starting from 1
2. Update the pairing logic to call reassignDisplayIndices() after all pairs are created from dropped files
3. Ensure UI displays indices correctly by always checking if displayIndex exists before rendering

Problem 2: Second Video Progress Bug (0% → 99% → 0% → slow)
Root Cause Identified:
* Progress callback from Video 1 bleeding into Video 2 due to async timing
* When Video 1 completes, there's a delay before the FFmpeg instance is fully released
* Video 2 starts, but Video 1's final progress event (99-100%) fires late and gets incorrectly assigned to Video 2's state
* This creates the illusion of jumping to 99%, then restarting at 0%
The Fix - Multi-Layered Defense:
1. Add pair ID tracking to progress callbacks - Bind the progress callback to a specific pair ID so it can't cross-contaminate
2. Implement progress callback guards - Check if the callback belongs to the currently processing video before updating state
3. Force cleanup between videos - Add explicit ffmpeg.off('progress') with a small delay to ensure previous callbacks are dead
4. Add state validation - Before updating progress, validate that the pair's isGenerating state matches the incoming update

📝 Implementation Plan
Here's the exact sequence of fixes I propose:
Phase 1: Fix Display Indices (Quick Win - 15 min)
1. Modify handleFileDrop in usePairingLogic.js:
    * After creating all pairs from dropped files
    * Call reassignDisplayIndices() to force sequential numbering 1, 2, 3, 4...
2. Update PairContainer rendering:
    * Check if displayIndex exists before showing "Pair #X"
    * Fallback to pair position in array if index is missing
Phase 2: Fix Progress Callback Isolation (Critical - 30 min)
1. In ffmpegProcessor.js:
    * Add pairId parameter to processVideoWithFFmpeg function
    * Store pairId in progress callback closure
    * Add guard: if (currentPairId !== pairId) return; in progress handler
2. In useFFmpeg.js:
    * Pass pair.id to processVideoWithFFmpeg
    * Before starting Video 2, add explicit cleanup:// Force cleanup of previous video's callbacks await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));  
3. Add state validation:
    * Before calling setVideoGenerationState, check:const currentState = getVideoGenerationState(pairId); if (!currentState.isGenerating && progress > 0) return; // Stale update  
Phase 3: Optimize Sequential Processing (Performance - 20 min)
1. Ensure proper FFmpeg instance cleanup:
    * After each video, explicitly call ffmpeg.terminate() if using pooling
    * Wait 50ms before starting next video
2. Improve pre-processing coordination:
    * Ensure prepared assets for Video 2 are ready BEFORE Video 1 completes
    * This eliminates the startup delay that makes Video 2 seem slow

🔬 Testing Strategy
After implementing fixes, test this specific scenario:
1. Upload 4 audio + 4 image files
2. Verify naming: Should show "Pair #1, #2, #3, #4" (not 2, 3, 4, blank)
3. Start generation
4. Watch Video 1: Should progress smoothly 0-100%
5. Watch Video 2: Should show 0%, then progressively count up WITHOUT jumping to 99%
6. Measure speed: Video 2 should be similar speed to Video 1 (within 10-15%)

⚙️ Technical Deep Dive
Why the second video seems slower:
* It's not actually slower in processing
* The jump to 99% creates a visual "reset" that makes it FEEL slower
* Once we fix the progress contamination, both videos will feel equally fast
Why Pair 2, 3, 4, blank happens:
* Default pairs get IDs before display indices assigned
* New pairs from drop get indices 1, 2
* But the default pairs already incremented the counter
* Result: Indices are 2, 3, 4, and the 4th gets no index

Would you like me to implement these fixes? I'll tackle them in phases so you can test each improvement incrementally. This is a textbook case of race conditions meeting state management - very fixable with proper isolation and cleanup! 🚀
