Got it — you want the **first screen** of your app (the upload/drag-and-drop page) to look and feel **exactly like in your screen recording**, with:

* the **same frosted glass background**
* **animated floating dots** in the background (like in Framer’s loading screens)
* and **your own custom text content** instead of the original text

**🧠 Replit Prompt (custom landing screen with animated dot background)**

> I am building a desktop app using **Electron + React + TailwindCSS**.
>
> I’m attaching:
>
> * `background.jpg` → the exact background from a screenshot (extracted from my video)
>
> Please make the **main landing screen** (the drag-and-drop/upload screen) look exactly like in the video I recorded:
>
> ---
>
> ✅ 1. Set `background.jpg` as the full-screen background
>
> * Use `object-cover`, and make sure it fills the screen responsively
> * Add a semi-transparent black layer (`bg-black bg-opacity-50`)
> * Apply `backdrop-blur-md` on top of it
> * Add a noise overlay (`/noise.png`, already in `public/`)
>
> ✅ 2. Add animated floating dots in the background
>
> * Similar to Framer’s Cloudpeak landing page
> * Subtle, smooth floating dot animation (CSS or JS okay)
> * Dots should float or pulse behind the content
>
> ✅ 3. Replace the original text with my custom text:
> **"Drop your audio + image to generate a video"**
>
> ✅ 4. Make sure all layout is responsive and doesn’t break existing functionality.
> ✅ 5. Make this only apply to the landing screen.

Let me know if you want me to generate the floating dots CSS or animated SVG for you — I can make them match the effect perfectly.
