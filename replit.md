# Type Beat Video Generator

## Overview

The Type Beat Video Generator is a desktop application built for music producers to create type beat videos by pairing audio files (MP3/WAV) with images (PNG/JPG). The app features a futuristic dark theme with neon accents and provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for file management and video generation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with modern hooks and functional components

- **Build System**: Webpack 5.99.9 with Babel transpilation for modern JavaScript features

### Desktop Application Framework
- **Platform**: Electron 37.1.0 for cross-platform desktop deployment
- **Architecture**: Main process handles system interactions, renderer process runs React app
- **Security**: Context isolation enabled with secure IPC communication via preload scripts
- **Window Management**: Hidden title bar with custom styling, optimized for wide desktop displays (1800x1000 default, 1600x900 minimum)

### Media Processing
- **Video Generation**: FFmpeg.wasm 0.12.15 for client-side video processing
- **Audio Analysis**: WaveSurfer.js 7.9.9 for waveform visualization and audio controls

- **Generated Videos**: Preview and management of output videos

## Data Flow

1. **File Input**: Users drag audio/image files into the application
2. **Validation**: Files are validated for correct format and type
3. **Pairing**: Automatic pairing logic creates audio-image combinations
4. **Preview**: Users can preview waveforms and images before processing
5. **Processing**: FFmpeg processes pairs into MP4 videos with progress tracking
6. **Output**: Generated videos are available for preview and export
